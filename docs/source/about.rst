What is Mythril Classic?
========================

Mythril Classic is a security analysis tool for Ethereum smart contracts. It was `introduced at HITBSecConf 2018 <https://github.com/b-mueller/smashing-smart-contracts/blob/master/smashing-smart-contracts-1of1.pdf>`_.

Mythril Classic detects a range of security issues, including integer underflows, owner-overwrite-to-Ether-withdrawal, and others. However, the analysis will not detect business logic issues and is not equivalent to formal verification.
